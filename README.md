## Features

- Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure
- All code are written in TypeScript
- Project setup with Angular CLI
- Use Akita state management
- Use TailwindCSS

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/Syuq/jira-angular-clone.git`
- `npm run install-dependencies`
- `cd frontend && npm start`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:4200/`

## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product:

### Proper backend API

I am currently using a `json` file for storing data.

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators etc. Most early stage companies tend to ignore this aspect of their product but in many cases they shouldn't, especially once their userbase starts growing.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

I only write test for some functions and skipped the end to end testing.
